        <h2>back home.</h2>
        <p>
            It's around 11 AM. <br>
            The sun is already in that uncomfortable spot in the sky where it feels like 3 PM and 10 AM at the same time.<br>
            You make your bed and wonder what's for lunch.<br>
            At the thought of food your torso begins to feel a bit too big. Full and hollow at the same time. <br>Something prods
            at your conscious in the back of your head.<br>
            Ignore it?
        </p>
        <button onclick="window.location='backhome.html'">Ignore</button>
        <button onclick="window.location='backhome.html'">Don't ignore</button>
    </body>

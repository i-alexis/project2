            <h2>morning</h2>
            <p>
                It’s somewhere in the vicinity of 9 AM.<br> 
                You cannot hear his voice, or his breathing. The call must have died at some point overnight, as usual. A quick look at your phone tells you this is true.<br>
                The bed is too damn comfortable but you roll out anyway.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Breakfast is standard fare.
                You deliberate for 15 minutes before settling on the same exact breakfast you’ve been eating for the last x months: two eggs and two pieces of canadian bacon. 
                A pinch of salt and lord knows how much pepper on the eggs. <br> Shake things up and add a sweet potato?

            <h2>maybe tomorrow.</h2>
            <p>
                No sweet potato today. It’ll probably be tastier tomorrow.<br>
                You fail to consider that it has been the same level of tasty since the time it was cooked.<br>
                A cup of coffee. You chase it down with some tea, and then some toothpaste.<br>
                It’s a nice day for a drive, just like any other day when it isn’t raining or snowing.<br>
                Where to?<br>

            <h2>the park.</h2>
            <p>
                You blast some tunes in the car as you do a lap around the park.<br>There are way too many people out here today, but other than that, the view is beautiful.

                You turn up the music and drive wherever impulse takes you.<br>
                A few minutes later, you have no idea where the hell you are.

                It's around 11 AM. <br>
                The sun is already in that uncomfortable spot in the sky where it feels like 3 PM and 10 AM at the same time.<br>
                You make your bed and wonder what's for lunch.<br>
                At the thought of food your torso begins to feel a bit too big. Full and hollow at the same time. <br>Something prods
                at your conscious in the back of your head.<br>
                Ignore it?

            <h2>ignore it.</h2>
            <p>
                You ignore the thoughts creeping up on you. You are not about to ruin your day this early on by feeling bad about something you have no control over.

                It’s going to be one of those days.<br>
                You fish your resistance bands and a PVC pipe out of your closet and set up your makeshift home gym.<br>
                Headphones in.<br>
                You go through the motions, trying to feel the burn. You’d rather focus on that than the other things bugging you right now.<br>

                It’s half past 12. <br>
                You jog downstairs to help Mom prepare lunch.<br>
                The right microwave settings and seasoning combinations for whatever it is you’re cooking are ingrained in your muscle memory. Meals have begun to feel like math.<br>
                Your family eats and chats about whatever is interesting today. Your parents talk about work, about the inefficient systems that make their jobs that much harder. <br>
                Everyone trades banter around the table. Good food, good times.<br>
                After everyone eats their fill, you help clear the table and go back up to your room.<br>
                The next half of your day has begun. <br>
                What will you do?

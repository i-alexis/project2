        <h2>morning</h2>
        <p>
            It’s somewhere in the vicinity of 9 AM.<br> 
            You cannot hear his voice, or his breathing. The call must have died at some point overnight, as usual. A quick look at your phone tells you this is true.<br>
            The bed is too damn comfortable but you roll out anyway.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Breakfast is standard fare.
            You deliberate for 15 minutes before settling on the same exact breakfast you’ve been eating for the last x months: two eggs and two pieces of canadian bacon. 
            A pinch of salt and lord knows how much pepper on the eggs. <br> Shake things up and add a sweet potato?

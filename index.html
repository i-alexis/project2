            <p>
                It’s somewhere in the vicinity of 9 AM.<br> 
                You cannot hear his voice, or his breathing. The call must have died at some point overnight, as usual. A quick look at your phone tells you this is true.<br>
                The bed is too damn comfortable but you roll out anyway.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Breakfast is standard fare.
                You deliberate for 15 minutes before settling on the same exact breakfast you’ve been eating for the last x months: two eggs and two pieces of canadian bacon. 
                A pinch of salt and lord knows how much pepper on the eggs. <br> Shake things up and add a sweet potato?

            <h2>maybe tomorrow.</h2>
            <p>
                No sweet potato today. It’ll probably be tastier tomorrow.<br>
                You fail to consider that it has been the same level of tasty since the time it was cooked.<br>
                A cup of coffee. You chase it down with some tea, and then some toothpaste.<br>
                It’s a nice day for a drive, just like any other day when it isn’t raining or snowing.<br>
                Where to?<br>

                You blast some tunes in the car as you do a lap around the park.<br>There are way too many people out here today, but other than that, the view is beautiful.

                It's around 11 AM. <br>
                The sun is already in that uncomfortable spot in the sky where it feels like 3 PM and 10 AM at the same time.<br>
                You make your bed and wonder what's for lunch.<br>
                At the thought of food your torso begins to feel a bit too big. Full and hollow at the same time. <br>Something prods
                at your conscious in the back of your head.<br>
                Ignore it?

            <p>
                You ignore the thoughts creeping up on you. You are not about to ruin your day this early on by feeling bad about something you have no control over.

                It’s going to be one of those days.<br>
                You fish your resistance bands and a PVC pipe out of your closet and set up your makeshift home gym.<br>
                Headphones in.<br>
                You go through the motions, trying to feel the burn. You’d rather focus on that than the other things bugging you right now.<br>

            <p>
                It’s half past 12. <br>
                You jog downstairs to help Mom prepare lunch.<br>
                The right microwave settings and seasoning combinations for whatever it is you’re cooking are ingrained in your muscle memory. Meals have begun to feel like math.<br>
                Your family eats and chats about whatever is interesting today. Your parents talk about work, about the inefficient systems that make their jobs that much harder. <br>
                Everyone trades banter around the table. Good food, good times.<br>
                After everyone eats their fill, you help clear the table and go back up to your room.<br>
                The next half of your day has begun. <br>
                What will you do?

                You open your laptop and take a look at the assignment you’re supposed to be doing.<br>
                Brain fog hits you like a bus, but you are too stubborn to go get some coffee or do anything at all to fix it. You decide instead to just do the damn thing.<br>
                Three hours later, you are still struggling to do the damn thing, but at least you’ve made some progress, which is better than none.<br>

                The ultimate cure for boredom is creating unsettling fantasy creatures and populating alien worlds with them. You open your laptop and fire up SPORE.<br>
                It’s been 12 years since the game’s release, and not once in that time have you gotten tired of it. <br>
                You spend the next few hours installing mods and testing a shiny new array of features.<br>

            <p>
                It’s about 4 in the afternoon.<br>
                This is the worst time of the day: it feels like the sky outside is mocking you. “Look how late it’s getting,” it says. “There’s so little daylight left and you’ve barely gotten anything done…”<br>
                Sometimes you feel like 4 PM should be illegal.<br>
                <br>
                You feel kind of peckish.<br>
                Eat a snack?<br>

                You head to the kitchen and check the refrigerator.<br>
                A choice apple sits in the fruit drawer. You proceed to clean it and slice it into quarters, cutting out the seeds and stem.<br>
                The taste is full of nostalgia. You remember that there was a time in your life when you would eat something like five apples a day.<br>
                Who the hell has time to eat five of these in a day?<br>
                Where were you getting all these apples?<br>
                Are these questions even worth asking?<br>
                <br>
                You finish the apple and clean the bowl.<br>
                <br>

                Take a shower?<br>

                You decide not to eat a snack and instead wait for dinner. Instead, you pour yourself a cup of coffee and eat a few pistachios to take the edge off. <br>
                Since you’re not doing anything right now, it might be a good time to do some self-care.<br>

                You decide to take a shower.<br>
                The warm water is soothing. You would fall asleep in here if it didn’t mean getting steamed like a dumpling.<br>
                Eventually the water begins to run cold. You finish up and get out of the water. So much for not getting steamed.   <br>

                You decide not to shower. You just had wash day after all, so it would probably be a good idea to wait another day so your hair doesn’t dry out.<br> 
                You wonder how much time you’ve spent worrying about your hair that could have been used to do other things. You find yourself vaguely wishing you were bald.<br>
                Mom is doing the online equivalent of window shopping. You pull up a chair next to her and the two of you make it a point to comment on the weirdest items you can find.<br>

                You and Mom set about cooking dinner. <br>
                The family convenes around the table, finished with work and the day’s responsibilities. You all take a bit more time to eat - you aren’t one to pass up the opportunity to unwind over a good meal.<br>

                You devote the rest of your night to winding down, finishing up what you were doing in your room earlier and getting ready to sleep.<br>
                Your boyfriend calls, having gotten home from work. You spend the rest of the night hanging out with him, and you fall asleep together on the phone after talking until the wee hours of the morning.<br>
                The days blur together mostly. It might be lack of sleep, or it might just be the way life is now.<br>
                Tomorrow is a new day. You don’t expect it to be much different, but at the very least you know it’s going to be okay.<br>

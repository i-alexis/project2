        <h2>maybe tomorrow.</h2>
        <p>
            No sweet potato today. It’ll probably be tastier tomorrow.<br>
            You fail to consider that it has been the same level of tasty since the time it was cooked.<br>
            A cup of coffee. You chase it down with some tea, and then some toothpaste.<br>
            It’s a nice day for a drive, just like any other day when it isn’t raining or snowing.<br>
            Where to?<br>
